A simple rock paper scissors game for The Odin Project.
Firstly, I made it without UI.
However, since I didn't know so much about layout-ing(?) things with CSS, I wanted to practice a bit, and I saw it as a great opportunity to learn and use the grid layout, so I updated the entire project to work with the UI I've made.
